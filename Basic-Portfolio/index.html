			<p>I was born in La Habana, Cuba and moved to Mexico City when I was two years old. I grew up in Mexico City and in 2012 moved to Austin, TX where I have been residing ever since. I went to the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in May 2016 with an Advertising degree. I took a Euro Trip right after graduation and then started working for a small media agency as an intern in multiple departments. It was there where I got exposed to the coding world and decided I wanted to expand my coding skillset. I am currently enrolled in the UT Austin Bootcamp where I am working to become a proficient full stack developer and land a job as such.</p>

			<p>I love playing all types of sports and going to sporting events! My favorite sport is football and my favorite team is the Oakland Raiders (soon to be Las Vegas Raiders)! I have been to three superbowls and hope to go to a few more. I am also passionate about photography, playing chess and videogames, and designing logos! I invite you to connect with me!</p>
